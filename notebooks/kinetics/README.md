# Chemical Kinetics Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks related to chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms.

## Topics Covered

- Reaction rates and rate laws
- Integrated rate laws (zero, first, second order)
- Half-life calculations
- Arrhenius equation and activation energy
- Reaction mechanisms
- Catalysis (homogeneous and heterogeneous)
- Enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten)
- Temperature dependence of reactions

## Example Notebooks

(Notebooks will be added here as they are contributed)

## Learning Objectives

Students working through these notebooks will be able to:
- Determine reaction order from experimental data
- Calculate rate constants and activation energies
- Propose reaction mechanisms consistent with rate laws
- Understand the role of catalysts in chemical reactions
