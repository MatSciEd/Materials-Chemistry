- Unit cells and lattice parameters
- Miller indices for planes and directions
- X-ray diffraction (Bragg's Law)
- Crystal structure determination
- Close packing (HCP, FCC, BCC)
- Defects in crystals
- Symmetry operations and space groups

## Example Notebooks

(Notebooks will be added here as they are contributed)

## Learning Objectives

Students working through these notebooks will be able to:
- Identify crystal systems and unit cells
- Calculate Miller indices for crystal planes
- Interpret X-ray diffraction patterns
- Visualize and analyze crystal structures
- Understand structure-property relationships in materials
