# Atomic Structure Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks related to atomic structure and electronic configurations.

## Topics Covered

- Electronic configurations
- Quantum numbers (n, l, m_l, m_s)
- Orbital shapes and orientations
- Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, Pauli exclusion principle
- Periodic trends (ionization energy, electron affinity, atomic radius)
- Shielding and effective nuclear charge

## Example Notebooks

(Notebooks will be added here as they are contributed)

## Learning Objectives

Students working through these notebooks will be able to:
- Write electron configurations for atoms and ions
- Understand quantum number assignments
- Visualize atomic orbitals
- Explain periodic trends based on electronic structure
