- Metallic bonding and band theory
- Molecular orbital theory
- Valence bond theory
- Hybridization (sp, sp2, sp3, etc.)
- VSEPR theory and molecular geometry
- Polarity and intermolecular forces

## Example Notebooks

(Notebooks will be added here as they are contributed)

## Learning Objectives

Students working through these notebooks will be able to:
- Predict bond types based on electronegativity
- Draw Lewis structures and molecular orbital diagrams
- Determine molecular geometry using VSEPR theory
- Understand the relationship between bonding and material properties
