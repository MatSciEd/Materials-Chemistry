# Thermodynamics Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks related to chemical thermodynamics.

## Topics Covered

- Enthalpy (ΔH) and heat of reaction
- Entropy (ΔS) and disorder
- Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and spontaneity
- Chemical equilibrium
- Phase diagrams and phase transitions
- Hess's Law
- Calorimetry
- Thermochemical cycles

## Example Notebooks

(Notebooks will be added here as they are contributed)

## Learning Objectives

Students working through these notebooks will be able to:
- Calculate enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy changes
- Predict reaction spontaneity
- Interpret and create phase diagrams
- Apply thermodynamic principles to real-world problems
