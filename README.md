## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MatSciEd/Materials-Chemistry.git
   cd Materials-Chemistry
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:

   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open any notebook to get started.

## Notebook Topics

The notebooks are organized into the following categories:

- **Atomic Structure**: Electronic configurations, quantum numbers, orbital shapes
- **Bonding**: Ionic, covalent, metallic bonding, molecular orbital theory
- **Thermodynamics**: Enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, phase diagrams
- **Kinetics**: Reaction rates, mechanisms, catalysis
- **Crystallography**: Crystal systems, unit cells, Miller indices, diffraction
- **Spectroscopy**: IR, UV-Vis, NMR, mass spectrometry
